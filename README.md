Ever asked yourself, *"Am I the asshole in this situation?!"* This application helps you answer that. Based on the famous subreddit [/r/AmItheAsshole](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/)

To find out if you are the asshole, simply go to the [website](https://github.com/logan-connolly/aita), type in the argument that you are having with someone (more detail the better) and click submit. The output should be a prediction with one of the following categories:

- **YTA**: You're the Asshole
- **NTA**: Not the Asshole
- **ESH**: Everyone Sucks here
- **NAH**: No Assholes here
- **INFO**: Not Enough Info

In order to help explain why a decision was made, the input text will also be highlighted on areas that contributed to the respective decision.

# Disclaimer

No data that you pass to Asshole Predictor will be saved. The model will only be trained on posts from [/r/AmItheAsshole](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/), which are monitored to prevent users from posting personally-identifying information like names, numbers, addresses, etc.
